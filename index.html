  <p>My duties began as an operator of the Amazon Robotics stow system at BFI4, a 9th generation AR fulfillment center. I was then selected by the leadership team to serve as an Ambassador, which is a trainer to new associates. I provided safety training, stow training, supervision and coaching for groups of 4-10 new hires at a time. I also delivered feedback, coached, audited performance, and re-trained experienced associates as requested by their area managers. As an inbound Water-Spider, I regularly performed labor intensive tasks which included pulling, delivering and preparing freight for Stowers, unloading trucks, and stacking/wrapping pallets.</p>
